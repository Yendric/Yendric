# My old websites
In this repository I store the websites that I made when I just started working with HTML.
At the time I was about 8 years old.
It's not that interesting, but here you go:

- Searchplay: https://yendric.github.io/SearchPlay/
- YVR-ONLINE: https://yendric.github.io/YVR-ONLINE/
- TCF: https://yendric.github.io/TheComputerFriends
